## Description
Play as Bonk, the Shiba Inu sensation, as you dash through perilous side-scrolling levels. Dodge devious traps, collect dazzling diamonds, and face off against the ultimate boss: a regulation-wielding juggernaut. Can you survive his endless onslaught of paperwork and political pitfalls? Rack up your score, stay alive, and become the top doge in this endlessly entertaining adventure!

The objective of the game is to collect as many diamonds as possible and "last forever" against the relentless attacks from the boss at the end of each level.  

Players can discover various special, and sometimes well-hidden, treasure NFTs throughout the game. Additionally, they will have the opportunity to sign their high score in their browser at the end of each level which may make the eligible for further rewards.
